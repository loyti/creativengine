Front-end Junior Developer
Junior Developer, Entry Level
Full-time

Brice Prather

Company:
-------

We are a web development shop with a focus on Congress. We currently power over
50 congressional websites, and do both internal and external projects. We have
recently started moving towards a fully isomorphic web application with React
and Node.js, though the majority of our code is legacy code. We are right next
to Playa Vista and have a small team.

We have the usual office amenities, including standing desks, modern equipment,
and lunches provided by the company on launch days and Fridays.

We have in-house training initiatives, and provide time and access for our employees
to work on new skills or refresh their old ones.

We are seeking a junior front-end developer. This is for a full-time, on-site
position at our Culver City location.

Candidate Profile:
-----------------

This position is ideal for someone who enjoys combining the art of design with
the art of programming. In particular, with a focus on improving usability with
design.

The ideal candidate will be comfortable with code, and doesn't mind learning
new (or old) technologies to get the job done. You care about doing things right,
even if you don't know how yet, and are open to feedback and training. You want
to push your comfort zones, but also don't mind doing things that you've mastered.

As a development shop, we also must be responsive to clients; this means that our
design choices are not always ours alone, but sometimes must respond to client
needs.

Though the position is for an entry-level candidate, if you grow quickly, so will
your responsibilities and position; your CreativEngine mentor will make sure that
are always learning and pushing yourself.
