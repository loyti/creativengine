# CreativEngine Design Challenge

Design a homepage for a fictional character

## Background

A character of your choosing has been elected to office. They will be representing
a political party of your choosing and be from a state of your choosing as well. 
The character cannot be any current political figure. Fictional and non-serious 
characters (e.g. Mario) are appropriate as long as the page is designed well.

You will have approximately one week to complete the challenge

## Challenge

The challenge is comprised of two parts:

* An HTML workup of your characters Homepage
* A file containing design decisions and reasoning

We are looking primarily at design ability and how the page looks.

### Homepage

The homepage must have:

* Twitter feed
* Office locations
* Press releases
* Social media icons

These should be a workup of the homepage in HTML/CSS/JS. It should be cross-browser 
compatible, and support browsers back to internet explorer 10. It will need to be 
mobile friendly. No links need to be live, and the twitterfeed and press releases 
can be static content (i.e. they do not need to pull from twitter or a live news-site).

Proper HTML and CSS or SASS should be used, with semantic HTML as much as possible. 
Twitter Bootstrap version 3 should also be used. Links on the homepage to other 
pages do not need to be valid, but should behave and be written as though they were.

If any build processes are used to minify/validate/lint your resources, please 
include those. 

### Design Decisions
In particular we are interested to understand why certain design choices were made.
Make decisions based on research on Web UI best practices and modern web design 
standards and trends.

### Tips

* Wireframe - look at balsamiq, though any other wireframe software is fine.
* Font choices - Select fonts from fonts.com or google fonts. 
    * Must be web usable and mobile friendly. 
    * Donâ€™t use defaults, but include fallbacks where appropriate.
* Color choices - Make sure the colors do not clash with the characters selected party.
* Research - Here are some senate sites that we have done in the past
    * https://www.manchin.senate.gov/
    * https://www.scott.senate.gov/
    * https://www.cortezmasto.senate.gov/
    * https://www.young.senate.gov/
    * https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov/
